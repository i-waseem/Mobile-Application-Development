# Mobile-Application-Development
This is a mobile app for my Mobile Application Development module in my final year. Itâ€™s a Charge Points Management System with user login, admin/user roles, and a clean design. Built with Java and Android Studio, it covers file handling, SQLite database management, and user-friendly interface design.
