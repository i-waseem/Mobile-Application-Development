# Mobile-Application-Development
This is a mobile app I built for my Mobile Application Development module in my final year. Itâ€™s a Charge Points Management System with features like user login, admin/user roles, and a clean, consistent design.

I created it using Java and Android Studio, and it covers key mobile development basics like handling files, managing a database with SQLite, and designing a user-friendly interface.
